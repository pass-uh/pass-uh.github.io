We’re not actively hiring a new PhD student at this moment. That said, if you are a current PhD student and would like to explore a collaborative research project in the areas above, we’d be happy to hear from you.

## Advisor Assignment at UH

You **do not need to secure a faculty advisor before applying** to UH’s Ph.D. or M.S. programs. Students are first admitted by the department. Research advising typically begins after admission, once mutual interest and fit are established.

Filling out a form or expressing interest is **non-binding** for either side. It simply opens the door for a possible research match.


*Due to the high volume of interest, we might not be able to respond to individual emails. Please fill out the form only, and we'll reach out if there’s a potential match.*
